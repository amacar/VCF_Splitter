VCF Splitter
=
I created this simple program for splitting single .vcf file that I get from Apple iCloud backup into multiple .vcf files. Some other vcf splitters have problems with special characters (čžš) so I write my own VCF Splitter.
It is very lightweight and don't need installation. You just run vcfSplit.exe and in first step select your *.vcf file and in second step select folder where do you want to save multiple *.vcf.

You can compile and build it by yourself or use provided vcfSplit.exe.

That's it :)
